# Streamer companion
## About this project
### What is this?
This project is an attempt at creating a companion for streamers that play games or talk about certain topics.
The bot itself is based on GPT4All which by itself doesn't know anything, in this project I will be attempting to strap a knowledge base that can be extended for any topic to the AI and have it provide info about the questions to the AI so that the AI can use it to summarize or word it as good as possible to answer the given question.

### Inspiration
The project was inspired by the streamer bots that can play games or answer chat messages.

# Status: (prototyping)
##   Roadmap
1. (🚧) Creating the first prototype:<br/>
-&ensp;(✔️) Creating a console for sending testing commands and prompts for the AI and the program<br/> 
-&ensp;(✔️) Basic implementation for interacting with the AI<br/>
-&ensp;(✔️) Temporary TTS for output without having to read<br/>
-&ensp;(🚧)Creating a prototype for the knowledge database system<br/>
2. (❌) Testing and improving parts that might need it<br/>
-&ensp;(❌) Add more knowledge on a subject to test the summarizing or answering abilities of the AI and so that people can actually start using it<br/>
-&ensp;(❌) Create a better TTS implementation, possibly using a different api/library<br/>
3. (❌) Make the project easier for others to use<br/>
   -&ensp;(❌) Make the console UI look better<br/>
4. (❌) Start extending the knowledge database of the AI<br/>
-&ensp;(❌) Complete the AI's knowledge on subjects<br/>
-&ensp;(❌) Add more subjects over time
