# Streamer companion
## About this project
### What is this?
This project is an attempt at creating a companion for streamers that play games or talk about certain topics.
The bot itself is based on GPT4All which by itself doesn't know anything, in this project I will be attempting to strap a knowledge base that can be extended for any topic to the AI and have it provide info about the questions to the AI so that the AI can use it to summarize or word it as good as possible to answer the given question.

### Inspiration
The project was inspired by the streamer bots that could play games or answer chat messages.
