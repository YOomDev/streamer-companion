# Streamer companion
## About this project
This project is an attempt at creating a companion for streamers that play games or talk about certain topics.
The bot itself is based on OpenAI's ChatGPT v3.5-turbo, this project has made attempts at using gpt4all before they
switch how the AI ran, but it couldn't summarize prompts, after ChatGPT got access to more recent stuff on the
internet it has also gained the ability to answer questions about games which this project tries to simplify.
